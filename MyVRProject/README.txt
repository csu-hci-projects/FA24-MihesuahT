12/6/24: HW2 Note on Instructions.

Complete project [https://drive.google.com/file/d/11MyaAXVOPRacl5ImH9Lfjt6e7jXOh6sO/view?usp=sharing].

I successfully uploaded the HW2 project files to the shared repository, allowing the project to be downloaded and tested directly in the UE5 editor. 
I attempted to upload the game build itself to the repository, but it exceeded the allowed file size. For now, I’ve added a Google Drive link to download the zipped game build. 

I wasn't able to build it with windows had very hard time so I built it with android and made it build that way, should build using that compared to windows but I had issues.

If you encounter any issues with the build, please reach out via Teams or email, and I’ll address them as soon as possible.

This is a solo group project so I did not meet with anyone else. I did everything in the project that is shared.
