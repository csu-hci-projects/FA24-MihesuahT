10/31/24: HW1 Note on Instructions.

Complete project [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kChFJQsNFleHQP0OZH8zxMLC0dFu1GlM/view?usp=sharing].

I successfully uploaded the HW1 project files to the shared repository, allowing the project to be downloaded and tested directly in the UE5 editor. 
I attempted to upload the game build itself to the repository, but it exceeded the allowed file size. For now, I’ve added a Google Drive link to download the zipped game build. 
If you encounter any issues with the build, please reach out via Teams or email, and I’ll address them as soon as possible.
